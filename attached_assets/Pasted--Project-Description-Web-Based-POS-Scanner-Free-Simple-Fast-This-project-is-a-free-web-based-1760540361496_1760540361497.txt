✅ Project Description – Web-Based POS Scanner (Free, Simple, Fast)

This project is a free web-based Point of Sale (POS) system designed for emergency use when cash registers or payment systems fail. It will run in any browser on a phone, tablet, or computer and does not require installation. It will scan barcodes using the device camera, lookup prices from a Pricebook (from Modisoft or any POS system), calculate totals with 8.25% tax, show a detailed item list, and allow checkout with manual payments in cash or using an on-site card reader. The entire project uses free tools and free hosting and is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only.

✅ Main Features

Barcode Scanning

Uses the device camera to scan barcodes.

Works on mobile phones and tablets.

Uses a free open-source scanning library such as QuaggaJS.

Supports scanning UPC and EAN barcodes used by most retail products.

Should work from multiple angles and lighting conditions.

Price Lookup

The app will load a Pricebook that contains barcodes, item names, and prices.

The Pricebook can be imported from Modisoft or another POS as CSV or Excel, then converted to JSON for fast lookup.

When a barcode is scanned, the app finds that product in the price list.

If a barcode doesn’t exist in the pricebook, the system shows a message and lets the user enter the price manually.

Shopping Cart System

Every scanned item is automatically added to a visible shopping cart.

The cart shows item name, barcode, and price.

Duplicate scans increase the quantity.

Option to remove items if needed.

Tax and Total

Shows Subtotal (total before tax).

Automatically applies 8.25% sales tax (can be changed later).

Shows Final Total clearly.

Clearly designed for fast checkout.

Payment Options

The system does not process payments online.

Instead, after calculating total, it gives the cashier two choices:

Cash Payment – shows how much to collect and calculates change.

Card Payment – instructs cashier to use the external card reader.

Keeps it simple and offline on purpose.

Receipts (optional future feature)

Can later add small printable text receipts.

Option to save orders as CSV for records.

✅ How It Works (Step-by-Step Flow)

Cashier opens the web app on their phone or tablet.

Clicks Start Scanning to activate camera barcode scanning.

Scans each product barcode using the phone camera.

App matches each barcode with price in the Pricebook.

Items appear in a shopping cart list on screen.

Subtotal and tax are automatically calculated.

Cashier clicks Checkout.

App shows Grand Total and payment instructions.

Cashier finishes payment outside app using:

Cash (manual)

style.css – styling to make it clean and readable

script.js – logic for barcode scanning and cart

pricebook.json – imported Modisoft pricebook data

✅ Hosting Options (Free Forever)

You can host this web app completely free using:

Replit for fastest startup (no setup)

GitHub Pages for 100% free static hosting

Netlify for drag-and-drop deployment

All allow mobile access using a public URL link you can bookmark.

✅ Pricebook Setup

Export products from Modisoft or other POS.

Convert file from Excel or CSV to JSON format.

Upload it directly into the app files.

Barcode scanning now identifies products instantly.

✅ Advanced Barcode Goals

Works under low light conditions.

Reads damaged or worn barcodes.

Rapid scan for busy checkout times.

Continuous scanning mode for speed.
